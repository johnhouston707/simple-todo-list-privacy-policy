# Privacy Policy

**Effective date: August 21, 2025**

This policy describes what information our Simple Todo List mobile application ("the App") collects and how we use it. The App is designed to run entirely on your device and does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information.

## Information We Collect

- **User-entered data:** When you create tasks or reminders in the App, the content is stored locally on your device using secure storage. The App does not transmit your tasks or reminders to our servers or any third party.

- **Notifications:** If you choose to schedule reminders, the App uses your device's local notification system to deliver notifications at the times you select. No personal information or device identifiers are shared with us or third parties to deliver notifications.

- **Analytics:** The App does not use any analytics or tracking services. We do not collect device information, usage patterns, or any other data for analytics or marketing.

## How We Use Information

All task data, reminders, and preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not process or store any of your data on our servers. Your information remains on your device unless you choose to manually export or sync it using third‑party services outside the App. We do not share or sell any of your data to third parties.

## Third‑Party Services

The App does not integrate with third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers. As such, no data is shared with third parties.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data by using secure storage within the App. However, please be aware that no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data. Because the App stores data locally on your device, maintaining the security of your device is essential.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete any such data.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the effective date above. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
